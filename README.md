# Hands‑On IT Support Portfolio #

### Welcome! This repository contains a structured portfolio of hands‑on labs and troubleshooting exercises designed to showcase my IT support skills across a range of technologies. I built these labs to simulate the real‑world tasks of a service desk technician or junior system administrator and to provide concrete evidence of my abilities when speaking with recruiters and hiring managers. Each section below summarizes the focus of the lab series.

### Overview

This portfolio demonstrates proficiency in:

Windows Server administration – Active Directory setup, file sharing, group policy management and user account administration.

Microsoft 365 management – Creating and managing user groups and accounts in the cloud environment.

Troubleshooting scenarios – Diagnosing and resolving network connectivity issues, account lockouts, password resets, software installation problems and printer configuration.

Networking labs (CCNA) – VLAN and subnetting exercises to build foundational networking knowledge.

Documentation & remote tools – Using Jira and remote‑desktop tools to document and resolve service requests.

Each lab folder contains screenshots of the steps taken and the final configurations. The screenshots serve as evidence of the tasks completed; the text below provides context and explains what each lab accomplished.

Part 1 – Windows Server Labs

These labs focus on common on‑premises server tasks:

Lab	Skills Demonstrated
AD‑Setup	Installing and configuring Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), promoting a server to a domain controller and creating organizational units.
Files‑Sharing	Creating and managing shared folders, assigning NTFS and share permissions, and testing access from client machines.
Group‑Policy	Designing and applying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings and deploy software across the domain.
User‑Management	Creating, modifying and disabling user accounts; resetting passwords; and delegating administrative permissions within AD.

Each of these sub‑directories includes a Screenshots folder that captures every step taken.

Part 2 – Microsoft 365 Labs

This section shifts to cloud‑based administration:

Group‑Setup – Creating security and distribution groups in Microsoft 365, assigning users to groups and configuring group settings.

User‑Management – Provisioning new users, resetting passwords and managing licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Screenshots demonstrate how to navigate the admin portal and complete each task.

Part 3 – Troubleshooting Scenarios

Real‑world troubleshooting is a core part of support work. This series addresses common issues:

Internet slow & network connectivity: diagnosing connectivity problems, checking cables and NIC settings, identifying bandwidth hogs and resolving DNS/DHCP issues.

User account locked & password reset: unlocking accounts, resetting passwords via Active Directory or Microsoft 365 and updating security policies to prevent lockouts.

Software not installing & printer issues: troubleshooting installer errors, managing compatibility settings, checking printer queues and reinstalling drivers.

For each scenario, the screenshots document the problem‑solving process step by step.

Part 4 – Networking Labs (CCNA)

These labs provide foundational networking practice:

Other‑Network Labs: configuring routers and switches, setting static and dynamic routes and testing connectivity between subnets.

VLAN‑Subnetting: designing a network addressing scheme, creating VLANs, configuring trunk ports and verifying inter‑VLAN routing.

Although the repository contains only screenshots, they illustrate the commands used and the topology diagrams drawn during the exercises.

Part 5 – Tools for Documentation & Remote Assistance

Good technicians document their work. This section highlights:

Jira/Service Desk: capturing issue details, updating tickets with troubleshooting notes and resolving tasks in a professional workflow.

Remote‑Desktop Tools: using remote support software to access user machines, perform troubleshooting and document actions taken.

How to Use This Portfolio

Each part of this repository is self‑contained. Browse to a section that interests you and open the Screenshots folder to view the visual record of my work. While the README.md files within individual labs are blank (the evidence is in the images), this master README explains the purpose and scope of each lab to give recruiters and hiring managers a clear picture of my capabilities.

Thank you for reviewing my portfolio! I hope these labs demonstrate not only my technical skills but also my commitment to continuous learning and thorough documentation.
